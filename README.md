# Loader Trials

New game mode to test your skills as The Loader. A run is 3 maps with a trial for each.

### Trials

- Trial 1: Hit the portals spread across the map.
- Trial 2: Kill all the enemies on the map but you have 1 HP.
- Trial 3: Hit all the portals. You take damage when grounded (5 sec delay) and you have no cooldowns.

I recommend [QuickRestart](https://thunderstore.io/package/AceOfShades/QuickRestart/) for quickly resetting runs and [LobbySeed](https://thunderstore.io/package/ValeX/LobbySeed/) for competing the same seed

## Changelog

**1.0.1**

- Reduces credits for trial 2 (less enemies)

**1.0.0**

- Release
